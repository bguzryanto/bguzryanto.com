            <strong>Hi</strong>, My name is Bagus Rianto
          </p>
          <p>
            I am software engineer at Grab based in ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬Singapore. I working on
            things that interest me the most, currently it's crossing across
            frontend development, high-scale distributed system, and cloud
            infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p>
            My daily activities consist of:
            <ul>
              <li>Building highly-scale distributed system using Go</li>
              <li>Building consumer and business facing frontend app</li>
              <li>
                Maintain infrastructure, systems operations and reliability
              </li>
              <li>
                Adhoc things that require skills on cli, code navigation,
                ripgrep, etc
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            To make my brain busy I keep in touch with machine learning field,
            linux development and play some MMORPG game. There are more things I
            want to say, how about follow me + send me a tweet at{" "}
